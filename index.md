# Welcome {#my-h1-id}

On this site we summarize our experience with application of optimal control in solid state NMR studies of protein samples. 

In case of N-CA and N-CO magnetization transfers, we obtain **1.5-times more signal** compared to carefully optimized ramp-CP experiments performed in the range of **MAS frequencies 13-20 kHz**. Our tm-SPICE shapes can be adapted to any MAS frequency in this range. 

#### What you find here  {#my-h4-id}

- Pulse shapes for dipolar recoupling experiments in [**Downloads**](/sequences.html){:class="menulink"}
- Description how to use these shapes in [**Experiments**](/experiments.html)
