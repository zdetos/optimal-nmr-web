  title:  "Broadband solid-state NMR of paramagnetic materials" 
  abstract: "Paramagnetic materials exhibit solid-state NMR spectra with very large shifts and shift 
          anisotropies.  In addition enhanced relaxation results in short coherence lifetimes, meaning 
          that signals decay rapidly following excitation.  The broad fast-relaxing resonances are 
          difficult to excite and observe. This presentation explores the ways in which these problems 
          can be addressed, including fast MAS, fast signal averaging, and broadband adiabatic pulse 
          schemes.  We explore the different adiabatic pulse schemes that can be used, and, using a 
          broad range of materials as test subjects, how these pulses can be incorporated into more 
          complex 2D experiments for both spin 1/2 and quadrupolar nuclei."

  title:   "Biomolecular MAS NMR: three good reasons for spinning faster"
  abstract: "The switch from the traditional MAS NMR approaches with 13C and 15N detection to 1H has 
             accelerated the site-specific analysis of complex immobilised biological systems and 
             opened the way to samples of higher molecular weight and available in limited amounts. 
             We will take the moves from a critical analysis of recent literature data, share our first 
             results on a prototype Bruker 0.4mm probe capable of rates exceeding 150 kHz and discuss 
             the expected impact of fast MAS on resolution and sensitivity of different biomolecular 
             NMR experiments."

  title:   "MAS probes from an industry perspective"
  abstract: "Magic-angle spinning NMR probes need to fulfill various technical requirements. Apart from RF capabilities
             for spin excitation and detection with high efficiency and homogeneity at multiple frequencies, sample 
             spinning speeds on the order of 10-100 kHz need to be attainable, often at given temperatures beyond 
             the ambient range. Secondary aspects indirectly linked to performance are producibility and usability, 
             which are relevant for efficient production of diverse probe portfolios and for the general accessibility 
             of MAS NMR, respectively.
             Substantial advances in probe instrumentation have been made in all above fields over the last decades. 
             However, physical and engineering limitations are quite diverse across the requirements, and some requirements
             are interlinked. An overview of these requirements will be given, along with an insight into theoretical 
             and practical limitations, recent achievements, the current state of technology and an outlook into future advances."

  title:   "Single-spin vector and exact effective Hamiltonian theory based design of optimal experiments in magnetic resonance"
  abstract: "Single-vector effective Hamiltonian theory (SV-EHT) and exact effective Hamiltonian theory (EEHT) methods are 
             described for analysis and design of advanced magnetic resonance experiments. These tools provide highly 
             accurate/exact descriptions of effective Hamiltonians with detailed information on linear and bilinear components 
             and their interplay in experiments for coherence/polarization transfer in presence of large offsets. The complementarity 
             and use of SV-EHT and EEHT is demonstrated for liquid-state NMR isotropic mixing and solid-state NMR dipolar recoupling 
             focusing on offset behavior, delicate aspects of resonance formation, and multiple-spin effective Hamiltonian/density 
             operator evolution based on single-spin analysis."

  title:   "Protein dynamics in large assemblies: from local side chain motions to functional large-scale mobility"
  abstract: "MAS NMR is an essential method to gain insights into dynamics at the atomic scale, independently 
        of the protein size. In this presentation I show recent applications to studies of dynamics. <br>
        In one part I will decipher how large-scale motion within a half-megadalton enzyme complex can 
        be detected and quantified using MAS NMR methods, and how these are linked to an apparently 
        allosteric network across the protein.   <br>
        In a second part, I will dwell onto details of side chain motion; in particular, I will investigate 
        how aromatic rings flip in different types of protein assemblies: globular proteins in a crystal, 
        amyloid fibers and large oligomeric proteins. The results shed light onto the packing of aromatic 
        rings within a protein interior and with other molecules."

  title:   "Pulse sequences for ultrafast MAS and proton detection applied to membrane proteins and membrane-assosicated proteins"
  abstract: "The ultrafast MAS regime ( ~50-100 kHz) brings opportunities and challenges. Recent developments 
       in pulse sequences will be discussed that apply to the ultrafast MAS regime, such as selective 
       proton recouping, torsion angle determination, and diagonal suppression. These new developments 
       will be highlighted in applications to biological solid-state NMR, in particular, for atomic 
       resolution structure determination of membrane proteins and proteins that mis-fold and aggregate 
       on membranes."
