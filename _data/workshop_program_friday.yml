  title:  "Broadband solid-state NMR of paramagnetic materials" 
  abstract: "Paramagnetic materials exhibit solid-state NMR spectra with very large shifts and shift 
          anisotropies.  In addition enhanced relaxation results in short coherence lifetimes, meaning 
          that signals decay rapidly following excitation.  The broad fast-relaxing resonances are 
          difficult to excite and observe. This presentation explores the ways in which these problems 
          can be addressed, including fast MAS, fast signal averaging, and broadband adiabatic pulse 
          schemes.  We explore the different adiabatic pulse schemes that can be used, and, using a 
          broad range of materials as test subjects, how these pulses can be incorporated into more 
          complex 2D experiments for both spin 1/2 and quadrupolar nuclei."

  title:   "A continuous approach to Floquet theory for pulse-sequence optimization in solid-state NMR"
  abstract: "Floquet theory uses a Fourier series expansion of the time-dependent Hamiltonian to transform
        the Hamiltonian into a time-independent representation. The price to pay for this transformation
        is the transition from a finite-dimensional to an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. Today,
        Floquet theory is often used in combination with analytical operator-based van Vleck perturbation
        theory to generate effective time-independent Hamiltonians.  <br>
        We present a modified Floquet framework that uses a continuous frequency space to describe and
        design solid-state NMR experiments using time-dependent Hamiltonians. The approach is similar to
        the well established Floquet treatment for NMR, but is not restricted to periodic Hamiltonians
        and allows the design of experiments in a reverse fashion. The framework is based on perturbation
        theory on a continuous Fourier space, which leads to effective, i.e. time-independent, Hamiltonians.
        This continuous Floquet approach simplifies the description of sequences with effective fields and
        correctly describes the finite width of resonance conditions for pulse sequences with finite mixing
        time.  <br>
        It allows, in certain cases, the back calculation of the pulse scheme from the desired effective
        Hamiltonian as a function of spin-system parameters. We show as an example how to back calculate
        the radio-frequency irradiation in the MIRROR experiment from the desired chemical-shift offset
        behavior of the sequence. It also enables us to optimize pulse sequences based on effective Hamiltonians
        without requiring the use of density-operator simulations. We will show first preliminary applications
        to frequency-selective recoupling in solid-state NMR under MAS."

  title:   "Protein dynamics in large assemblies: from local side chain motions to functional large-scale mobility"
  abstract: "MAS NMR is an essential method to gain insights into dynamics at the atomic scale, independently 
        of the protein size. In this presentation I show recent applications to studies of dynamics. <br>
        In one part I will decipher how large-scale motion within a half-megadalton enzyme complex can 
        be detected and quantified using MAS NMR methods, and how these are linked to an apparently 
        allosteric network across the protein.   <br>
        In a second part, I will dwell onto details of side chain motion; in particular, I will investigate 
        how aromatic rings flip in different types of protein assemblies: globular proteins in a crystal, 
        amyloid fibers and large oligomeric proteins. The results shed light onto the packing of aromatic 
        rings within a protein interior and with other molecules."

  title:   "Pulse sequences for ultrafast MAS and proton detection applied to membrane proteins and membrane-assosicated proteins"
  abstract: "The ultrafast MAS regime ( ~50-100 kHz) brings opportunities and challenges. Recent developments 
       in pulse sequences will be discussed that apply to the ultrafast MAS regime, such as selective 
       proton recouping, torsion angle determination, and diagonal suppression. These new developments 
       will be highlighted in applications to biological solid-state NMR, in particular, for atomic 
       resolution structure determination of membrane proteins and proteins that mis-fold and aggregate 
       on membranes."
