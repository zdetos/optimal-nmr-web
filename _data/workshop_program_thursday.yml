  title: "Optimal control pulses for the NC transfer in membrane protein solid-state NMR"
  abstract: "Using solid state NMR, membrane proteins can be studied in a lipid bilayer environment. 
        The resulting spectra are often quite complex and suffer from spectral overlap. Therefore, 
        often highly selective isotope labelling schemes are applied. Magnetization transfer steps 
        in these sparsely labelled samples are difficult to optimize, especially when narrow 
        conditions have to be met, due to the low signal-to-noise ratio in the 1D spectra. Here we 
        show, for the case of moderate MAS frequencies at high B0-field, that such optimizations can
        be sped up significantly using optimal control pulses. We will also discuss the current 
        limitations of these pulses in our applications."

  title: "Higher-dimensionality solid-state NMR for facilitated resonance assignment and elucidation of protein dynamics"
  abstract: "Proton-detected solid-state NMR spectroscopy has enabled the combined use of complex pulse 
        sequences and short recycle delays, thereby granting both, high signal to noise per unit 
        time and peak dispersion. As a consequence, proteins with high-molecular-weight asymmetric 
        units have become amenable for solid-state NMR, both in terms of resonance assignment 
        (including directly chemical-shift-derived aspects of NMR like secondary structure and 
        chemical properties) as well as regarding the assessment of structure and dynamics. Here, 
        I will report on the implementation of such strategies, in particular higher-dimensionality 
        sequences, to help exceed the boundaries of high molecular weight in micro-crystalline 
        enzymes. The talk will allow for discussion of the prospects and possible applications to 
        facilitate future solid-state NMR on biomolecules and beyond."

  title:   "Dealing with instrument response functions within GRAPE framework"
  abstract: "Response functions of resonant circuits create ringing artefacts if their input changes 
            rapidly. When physical limits of electromagnetic spectroscopies are explored, this creates 
            two types of problems. Firstly, simulation: the system must be propagated accurately 
            through every oscillatory transient, this may be computationally expensive. Secondly, 
            optimal control optimisation: instrument response must be taken into account; it may be 
            advantageous to design pulses that are resilient to instrumental distortions. At the 
            root of both problems is the popular piecewise-constant approximation for control 
            sequences; in magnetic resonance it has persisted since the earliest days. In this paper, 
            we report an implementation and some benchmarks for simulation and optimal control 
            routines that use more recent Lie-group methods. Those simulate and optimise control 
            pulses that are piecewise-polynomial – easier to generate on modern hardware and more 
            resilient to instrumental distortions. However, the basic mathematics of magnetic 
            resonance simulation and optimal control does require an update."

  title:   "ARTINA: deep learning-based approach to fully automated chemical shift assignment and protein structure determination"
  abstract: "The analysis of multidimensional NMR spectra of macromolecules is considered to be a 
           work-intensive task, which constitutes a bottleneck in NMR-driven structural biology research. 
           Usually, it takes weeks or months of manual work to transform a set of raw NMR spectra into 
           the protein structure model. Automation of this process is an open problem, formulated in 
           the field about three decades ago. In this study, we addressed this challenge by combining 
           deep learning with methods available in CYANA. 
           Our method, ARTINA, uses as input only protein sequence and set of 2D/3D/4D Fourier transformed 
           NMR spectra, delivering as output: (a) cross-peak coordinates, (b) chemical shifts, 
           (c) distance restraints, and (d) protein structure. The proposed technique works strictly 
           without any human intervention, allowing to get (a), (b), (c) and/or (d) within hours after 
           the completion of measurement. 
           ARTINA uses a deep residual neural network, trained on 675,324 diverse labelled examples, 
           to identify and deconvolve cross-peaks in the spectrum. Detected signal coordinates undergo 
           automated chemical shift assignment with FLYA, which is facilitated by a deep graph neural 
           network. In the final step, ARTINA calculates 9 structure candidates with CYANA, and orders 
           them by their expected quality using gradient boosted trees. 
           The method was tested on a 100-protein benchmark dataset (1329 2D/3D/4D NMR spectra), 
           demonstrating its ability to solve structures with 1.44 A backbone median RMSD to the PDB 
           reference, and to identify 91.36% correct NMR resonance assignments. ARTINA is publicly 
           available to non-commercial users within the NMRtist platform."
